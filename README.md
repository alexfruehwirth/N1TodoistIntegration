# Todoist Integration for Nylas N1

This is a Todoist integration for Nylas N1. 

This plugin is still under development.

This package is inspired by [anopensourceguy/TodoistN1](https://github.com/anopensourceguy/TodoistN1). As with that project, you must create a development app on todoist.com, and then

1. enter in user's own clientSecret and clientKey in todoistCredentials in todoist- sidebar.jsx
2. enter in redirect_uri in login.jsx
