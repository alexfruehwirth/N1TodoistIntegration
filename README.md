# Todoist Integration for Nylas N1

This is a Todoist integration for [Nylas N1](https://nylas.com/n1)

This plugin is still under development. Bug reports, feature requests are appreciated!

This package is inspired by [anopensourceguy/TodoistN1](https://github.com/anopensourceguy/TodoistN1). As with that project, you must create a development app on todoist.com, and then

1. enter in user's own clientSecret and clientKey in todoistCredentials in todoist- sidebar.jsx
2. enter in redirect_uri in login.jsx
